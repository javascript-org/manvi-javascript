JavaScript supports several data types. Here are the commonly used data types in JavaScript:

1. Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
   Example: `let age = 25;`

2. String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
   Example: `let name = "John";`

3. Boolean: Represents a logical value, either `true` or `false`.
   Example: `let isStudent = true;`

4. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   Example: `let city;`

5. null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   Example: `let car = null;`

6. Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each value can be of any data type.
   Example: `let person = { name: "John", age: 25 };`

7. Array: Represents an ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets ([]).
   Example: `let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];`

8. Function: Represents a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
   Example: `function greet() { console.log("Hello!"); }`

9. Symbol: Represents a unique identifier, often used as property keys in objects.
   Example: `let id = Symbol("uniqueId");`

These are the basic data types in JavaScript. Additionally, JavaScript also supports other advanced data types and structures such as Maps, Sets, Dates, and more, which provide specific functionalities for certain use cases.

## What is ES6

ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6, which is the 6th edition of the ECMAScript standard. ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language specification that serves as the foundation for languages like JavaScript. ES6 was released in 2015 and introduced several new features and improvements to JavaScript.
